# GanAddColorProject

Design and Implementation of Cartoon Coloring System Based on GAN is my undergraduate graduation project. The system has three functional modules, which are image processing module, integral mall module and customer service chat module. The image processing module allows users to select color model algorithms, such as DeOldify, U-2-Net and Pix2PixGAN algorithm reproduced by me, to process images. The integral mall module can be used by users to exchange integral products. Customer service chat module can let users chat with customer service in real time to solve problems. This graduation project was rated as the Excellent Undergraduate Graduation Project of Northeastern University in 2022.
